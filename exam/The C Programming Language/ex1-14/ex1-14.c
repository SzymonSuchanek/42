	"Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. "
	"Lorem Ipsum has been the industrys standard dummy text ever since the "
	", when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to "
	"make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but "
	"also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. "
	"It was popularised in the  with the release of Letraset sheets containing "
	"Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software "
	"like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum."

	"Why do we use it?"
	"It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the "
	"readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using "
	"Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, "
	"as opposed to using Content here, content here, making it look like readable "
	"English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem "
	"Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for lorem ipsum will uncover "
	"many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the "
	"years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the "
	"like).";
